    <h3>Overview </h3>
 		<p class="info">
      HandWave is an Android library that allows developers to add touch-free capabilities to their mobile applications. HandWave uses the built-in, forward-facing camera on a device to recognize usersâ€™ in-air gestures. The API provides developers with access to a variety of touch-free gestures which invoke callback functions when detected.

    <h3>Overview </h3>
 		<p class="info">   
    The motivation for this project is that diagnostic tests routinely administered in well-equipped clinical laboratories are often not appropriate for low-resource settings. Paper-based diagnostic tests, however, present an inexpensive and reliable diagnostic tool. The Android application being developed enables the diagnosis of paper-based tests on a mobile device by processing an image of the test strips. The software interprets test results using computer vision algorithms run on a mobile device and provides the user with an objective and automated diagnosis.

     <h3>Overview </h3>
 		<p class="info"> 
    Interactive voice forums, in which users record audio messages that can later be heard by others, have been used to report, share, and access information in developing regions. Users call a system which then prompts them to either record a message or listen to previously recorded messages.  
    The operational costs associated with these phone calls often prevent scaling these systems beyond the pilot stage. As smartphones become cheaper, their accessibility and prevalence are expected to increase.
    Using the Android platform, we implemented an application to support CGNet Swara, a voice-based platform for citizen journalism launched in rural India in 2010.
