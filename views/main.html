		I am a senior at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA where I am working towards a double degree in Computer Science and Bioengineering. I will be graduating in June 2016. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		I currently work with <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/luisceze" target="_blank" title="" style="">Luis Ceze</a> researching ways in which DNA molecules can be used to store data long-term.
	</p>
	<p>
	    In the past, I worked as a researcher in the Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) lab within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.  My work focused on mobile systems, specifically those targeted at low resource settings. My advisors were <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gaetano/" target="_blank" title="" style="">Gaetano Borriello</a> and <a href="http://nixdell.com" target="_blank" title="" style="">Nicki Dell</a>.

		Prior to joining the ICTD lab, I worked for two and a half years as a researcher within the Department of Bioengineering. I was advised by <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/bioe/portfolio-items/sanders/" target="_blank" title="" style="">Joan Sanders</a>, <a href="http://www.rehab.washington.edu/education/faculty/nonproviderbios/hafner.asp" target="_blank" title="" style="">Brian Hafner</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-cagle/7/8b8/179" target="_blank" title="" style=""> John Cagle</a>. My research focused on designing devices to improve prosthetic socket fit and reduce discomfort for individuals with lower limb amputations.

	<p>
		In my spare time, I enjoy birdwatching, acrylic painting, and biking.
