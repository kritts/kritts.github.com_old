  	I began working in the ICTD lab during the summer of 2013. During that time, I worked on the development and analysis of an Android library called <a href="https://github.com/kritts/HandWave">HandWave</a>. The HandWave API provides developers with easy, high-level access to a variety of touch-free gestures that can be detected using any  smartphone equipped with a basic forward-facing camera. Health workers who often handle potentially infectious biological material may rely on mobile devices to assist with medical tasks. We reasoned that touch-free capabilities could be a way in which these health workers could interact with a mobile device. Our paper on this work was just accepted to be published at HotMobile 2015.

    I joined the lab again in January 2014 where I've been working as an undergraduate researcher ever since. My work is focused on using technology as a tool in low-income regions to improve remote health monitoring and disease detection. It is a collaborative project with both the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Bioengineering. The motivation for the work is that diagnostic tests routinely administered in well-equipped clinical laboratories are often not appropriate for low-resource settings. However, paper-based diagnostic tests present an inexpensive and reliable diagnostic tool. My research consists of the development and analysis of an Android application that enables the diagnosis of paper-based tests on a mobile device. The software interprets test results using computer vision algorithms run on a mobile device and provides health workers with an objective and automated diagnosis at the point of care.
