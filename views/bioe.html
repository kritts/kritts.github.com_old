    From September 2011 - February 2014 I worked in Dr. Joan Sanders's research lab within the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Washington. It was my first time conducting research outside of the classroom and it was a formative experience for me. The lab focuses on creating innovative measurement techniques to understand physiological and biomechanical issues that individuals with lower limb amputations face.

    I was fortunate to have been given the opportunity to work on multiple different projects within the lab. One of the main projects I worked on focused on examining changes in prosthetic sock thickness over time. Over the course of a day, as an individual conducts different forms of physical activity, the amount of fluid in their lower limb changes. This can be particularly troublesome for individuals with lower limb amputations since the size and shape of their socket is static. Discrepancies in the shape and size of the residual limb of an individual and of their prosthetic socket can result in gait instability and discomfort. Prosthetic socks are commonly used to accommodate for volume loss or gain over the course of a day. With wear, the material properties of these socks change and my research project was focused on quantifying the changes in thickness of these socks over wear. The motivation for this research was that with a better understanding of prosthetic sock thickness changes with use, practitioners would be able to provide patients with more appropriate volume management strategies. A journal publication for this work is currently being peer-reviewed.

    Another study I worked on examined the frequency with which individuals added or removed socks over the course of the day. We gave participants in the study a "sock log" in which they were asked to record the types of socks they were wearing and at what times during the day they changed their socks. We believed that a better understanding of a patient's prosthetic sock use could enhance a practitioner's volume management strategies or troubleshoot fitting issues. We published a journal paper about this work in <a href="pdfs/DSilva_POI_2014.pdf"> Prosthetics and Orthotics International.</a>

    One of my favorite and last projects in the lab was the development of a wearable device (and the software that ran on the Arduino chip within it) to determine the amount of time an individual spends on different phases of the gait cycle. Subjects in our study wore the device around their waist with force sensitive resistors (FSRs) that were placed at various locations within the subject's prosthesis. Based on numerous factors, such as changes in the amount of force applied onto the resistors, we created an algorithm to predict phases of the gait cycle (ie. whether a person was sitting, standing or walking). We reasoned that an algorithm to determine when an individual was sitting, standing, or walking could be useful in making sockets adaptable. This project allowed me to build software and see it being used. After realizing my interest in software development and working for two and a half years in the Sanders lab, I left to work in a research lab within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering which you can read more about <a href="#/experiences/ictd"> here.</a>
